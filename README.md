---

## 🎨 Theming & Customization
- `<html>` carries `data-theme="light"` or `data-theme="dark"`  
- Controlled via CSS variables in `:root`  
- Key variables:  
  - Colors: `--bg, --surface, --text, --primary, --danger, ...`  
  - Components: `--card-radius, --radius, --shadow-1`  
- Update `<select>` options in `index.html` to add or rename categories  

---

## 🗄️ Data Persistence
- Expenses stored in **localStorage**  
- Data stays until manually cleared  
- Use **Clear All** to wipe storage  

---

## 🧪 Exporting
- Export visible (filtered/sorted) list as `.txt`  
- Can be extended for **CSV** or **JSON** export  

---

## 🌐 Browser Support
- Works on latest **Chrome, Firefox, Safari**  
- Advanced CSS (e.g., `color-mix`) looks best on up-to-date browsers  
- May degrade on very old browsers  

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **Nothing shows?** → Check required fields or filters  
- **Theme doesn’t stick?** → Ensure localStorage is allowed (private browsing may block it)  
- **Export doesn’t download?** → Try desktop browser (some mobile browsers restrict downloads)
